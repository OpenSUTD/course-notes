**Review of Excel functions**

- NORMSDIST - the cumulative distribution function $\Phi(x)$ for standard normal distribution
- NORMSINV - inverse of the standard normal CDF
- PHI - probability density function $\phi(x)$ for a standard normal distribution
- NORMDIST(x,mean,standard_dev,cumulative)
  - x - The value for which you want the distribution.
  - mean - The arithmetic mean of the distribution.
  - standard_dev - The standard deviation of the distribution.
  - cumulative - TRUE or FALSE
    - If TRUE, NORMDIST returns the cumulative distribution function
    - if FALSE, it returns the probability density function.

## News Vendor model

This is periodic review

**Variables and constants**

- Demand of the period
  - with known **continuous** probability distribution $g(x)$ or $G(x)$
  - that has mean $\theta$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
- Overage cost $c_o$
- Shortage cost $c_s$ (which is also unit profit)

**Assumptions**

- Planning is done for a single period
- Deliveries are made in advance of demand
- No fixed cost (you are making a purchase at the start of each period anyway)
- Products can analysed individually - either a single product or no interactions between products

**Decison variable**

- $Q$ Order / production quantity (product units)

**Opitimal order quantity $Q^*$**

- $G(Q^*) = \dfrac{c_s}{c_o + c_s}$
- Where **incremental** overage cost exceed **incremental** shortage cost

**Performance measures** (for a certain order quantity $Q$)

- Expected lost sales (units)
  - calculated based on the demand distribution and $Q$
  - ![NV-formulas](assets/NV-formulas.png)
- Expected demand (units)
  - $\mu$ of the given assumed distribution
- Expected sales (units)
  - expected demand $\mu$ $-$ expected lost sales
- Expected leftover inventory (units)
  - $Q$ the chosen supply $-$ expected sales
- Expected profit (dollars)
  - expected sales $\times$ shortage cost $â€“$ expected leftover inventory $\times$ overage cost
- Probability of shortage or overage
  - read from the probability distribution for demand

**Identities** (for all $Q$)

- Specified supply $Q$ $=$ Expected sales $+$ Expected leftover inventory
- Expected demand $\mu$ $=$ Expected sales $+$ Expected lost sales



**News Vendor Model with Risk pooling**

- Why not we use blanks to fulfill unmet demand of star player Jerseys?
  - If there is shortage, we can print using the blank
  - Printing in the US **is still more expensive**, so there is tradeoff
- Differences
  - Cost of overage is the same (could only salvage)
  - Cost of shortage is different
    - depends if blank is available
    - whether is it available is a probability (**previously calculated**)
      - for each of the two scenario there is a cost
    - **this is an approximate**
- Are we now only ordering blanks from the CM?
  - No, but less

How is the profit **calculated**? **Example**?





## Order-up-to model

Periodic review

The computation is similar to a newsvendor model. (Not in SUTD syllabus, I have not studied this for SMU supply chain which is tested in the finals.)



**Variables and constants**

- Demand of the period
  - with known **continuous** probability distribution $g(x)$ or $G(x)$
  - that has mean $\theta$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
- Holding cost of inventory per unit per time $h$
- Backorder cost per unit $b$
- Duration of each period $t$
- Lead time $l$ (or replenishment time, fixed and known)



**Assumptions**

- Orders are made at the start of every period of duration $t$.

- Fixed and known replenishment lead time.

  

**Decison variable**

The stock to order up to $S$.

This is like a Newsvendor model in which the order quantity is $S$ and the demand distribution is demand over $l+t$ (or in $l/t + 1$ periods of length $t$).

- After you make your order at the start of each period, you can no longer influence whether will you stockout from now until $l + t$. You need to wait for the next period to start ordering again, and the goods will only arrive at $l + t$.



**Opitimal order quantity $Q^*$**

$c_o = h \times t$

$c_u = b$

Critical ratio = $\dfrac{c_u}{c_o + c_u}$

(Does the dimensions for $c_o$ make sense?)



**Performance measure**

Similar to the newsvendor model




<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Base-stock model

This is continuous review.

**Variables and constants**

- Lead time $l$ (or replenishment time, fixed and known)
- Demand during replenishment lead time
  - with known **continuous** probability distribution $g(x)$ or $G(x)$
  - that has mean $\theta$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
  - (demand still happens one at a time)
- Unit holding cost $h$ (per unit, per time)
- Unit backorder cost $b$ (per unit, per time)

**Assumptions**

- Demand occurs one at a time, with i.i.d. interarrival times
- Replenishment units are ordered one at a time
- Unsatisfied demand is backordered, and will be fulfilled.
- No fixed cost. (The order is placed one at a time anyways)
- Products can analysed individually - either a single product or no interactions between products
- Initial amount of inventory is $r+1$

**Decision variable**

- Reorder point $r$
  - $r+1$ is the base-stock level

**Optimal** base-stock level $r^*+1$

- $G(r^*+1) = \dfrac{b}{h+b}$
- Where **incremental** holding cost exceed **incremental** backorder cost

**Performance measures** (for a certain reorder point $r$)

- Safety stock level $r - \theta$
- Expected backorder level
  - $B(r+1) = \int_{r+1}^{\infty} \enspace (x-r-1) \enspace  g(x) \enspace dx$
  - If demand is normal
    - $(\theta -r -1)\left( 1 - \Phi \left[ \dfrac{r+1 - \theta}{\sigma} \right] \right) + \sigma \phi \left[\dfrac{r+1-\theta}{\sigma}\right]$
- Expected inventory level
  - (identity) $r+1 - \theta +$ Expected backorder level
  - Current inventory position = on-hand inventory + orders - backorders (Because negative inventory level is considered zero inventory)
- Fill rate
  - Fraction of demand satisfied instantaneously from on-hand inventory
  - $P (X \leq r+1) = P \left( \dfrac{X - \theta}{\sigma} \leq \dfrac{r+1-\theta}{\sigma} \right)$

**Identities** for all $r$

- Expected inventory level per unit time + Expected lead time demand = Expected number of backorders per unit time + Reorder point + 1

**Model design**

- Why r-plus-one?
  - This is so that $r$ is the reorder point, which can be zero.

**Questions**

- What happens if you have have a fixed cost of ordering?

- Where incremental holding cost exceed decremental fixed order cost



**Performance measures**

- Total cost per unit time
  - $Y(Q) = \dfrac{hQ}{2} + \dfrac{AD}{Q} + cD$
- Total cost per unit time **per unit product** (not incremental)
  - $Y'(Q) = \dfrac{hQ}{2D} + \dfrac{A}{Q} + c$
- Average inventory
  - $\dfrac{Q}{2}$

![EOQ-cost](assets/EOQ-cost.png)


**Extension of EOQ**

- Non-zero supply lead times
  - You will just order $L$ in advance
  - $Q^*$ is unchanged
- Non-zero safety stocks
  - Only a constant (holding cost) is added to the total cost
  - $Q^*$ is unchanged
- Finite production capacity
  - Economic Production Quantity Model


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Economic Production Quantity Model

- Fixed cost to place an order $A$
- Unit purchase/production cost $c$
- Unit holding cost $h$

**Assumptions**

**Decision variable**

- $Q$ The size of an order

**Optimal** order quantity $Q^*$

- $Q^* = \sqrt{2ADh\left(1-\dfrac{D}{P}\right)} + cD$

  - $Y(Q) = \dfrac{hQ}{2}\left(1-\dfrac{D}{P}\right) + \dfrac{AD}{Q} + cD$
- Total cost per unit time **per unit product** (not incremental)
  - $Y'(Q) = \dfrac{hQ}{2D}\left(1-\dfrac{D}{P}\right) + \dfrac{A}{Q} + c$

- Average inventory
  - $\dfrac{Q}{2} \left( 1 - \dfrac{D}{P} \right)$

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## (Q,r) model

This is continuous review.

**Variables and constants**

- Demand
  - with known **continuous** probability distribution $g(x)$ or $G(x)$
  - that has mean $\theta$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
  - (demand still happens one at a time)
- Fixed cost $A$ is associated with placing an order
- Fixed and known replenishment lead time $l$
- Unit purchase/production cost $c$ (per unit)
- Unit holding cost $h$ (per unit, per time)
- Unit backorder cost $b$ (per unit, per time)

**Assumptions**

- Unstatisifed demand is backordered
- Products can analysed individually - either a single product or no interactions between products

**Decision variable**

**Optimal decision variables**

- $Q^* = \sqrt{\dfrac{2AD}{h}}$
  - Where marginal fixed order costs exceeds marginal holding costs 
- $G(r^*) = \dfrac{b}{b+h}$
  - Where marginal holding cost exceeds marginal backorder costs



**Performance measures**

- Safety stock level $s= r - \theta$
- Expected backorder level
  - $B(Q,r) = \frac{1}{Q} \int_r^{r+Q} B(x) dx \lessapprox B(r)$
    - The appoximation is allowed as $\int_{r+Q}^{\infty} B(x) dx \gtrapprox 0 $
  - If demand is normal
  - $B(r) = (\theta - r)\left(1 - \Phi \left[ \dfrac{r-\theta}{\sigma}  \right] \right) + \sigma \phi \left[ \dfrac{r-\theta}{\sigma} \right]$
  
- Expected inventory level
  - $I(Q,r) = \frac{1}{Q} \int_r^{r+Q} I(x) dx \\ = \dfrac{Q}{2} + r - \theta + B(Q,r)$

- Fill rate
  - $S(Q,r) = \dfrac{1}{Q} \int_r^{r+Q} G(x) dx \\ = 1 - \frac{1}{Q}[B(r) - B(r+Q)] \\ \gtrapprox G(r) = \Phi \left[ \dfrac{r - \theta}{\sigma} \right] $ 

- Expected total cost
  - $Y(Q,r) = A \cdot F(Q,r) + h \cdot I(Q,r) + b \cdot B(Q,r)$



**Identities** for all $r$ and $Q$

- Inventory position = On-hand inventory + outstanding orders â€“ backorders
  - Please understand which is which
- Inventory position is uniformly distributed between $r$ and $r+Q$
